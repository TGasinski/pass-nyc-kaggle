    "## Overview (from Kaggle): \n",
    "\n",
    "PASSNYC and its partners provide outreach services that improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in these specialized high schools. The current process of identifying schools is effective, but PASSNYC could have an even greater impact with a more informed, granular approach to quantifying the potential for outreach at a given school. Proxies that have been good indicators of these types of schools include data on English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, Students on Free/Reduced Lunch, and Students with Temporary Housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this challenge is to assess the needs of students by using publicly available data to quantify the challenges they face in taking the SHSAT. The best solutions will enable PASSNYC to identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions for the Main Prize Track will be judged based on the following general criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance - How well does the solution match schools and the needs of students to PASSNYC services? PASSNYC will not be able to live test every submission, so a strong entry will clearly articulate why it is effective at tackling the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Influential - The PASSNYC team wants to put the winning submissions to work quickly. Therefore a good entry will be easy to understand and will enable PASSNYC to convince stakeholders where services are needed the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shareable - PASSNYC works with over 60 partner organizations to offer services such as test preparation, tutoring, mentoring, extracurricular programs, educational consultants, community and student groups, trade associations, and more. Winning submissions will be able to provide convincing insights to a wide subset of these organizations."

    "To help PASSNYC better identify potential schools to target with their test, I will use some basic machine learning techniques to predict which schools will most benefit from PASSNYC's services. \n",

    "To do so, I will examine schools who have successfully participated in PASSNYC programs and try to identify why these schools were successful. But what does \"successful\" in this context mean? \n",

    "Unfortunately, the data given to me is very limited. I only have access to the number of students who enrolled in the PASSNYC program, the number of students who enrolled in the SHSAT test, and the number of students who actually took this test. Due to such limitations, I will define \"successful\" as the schools with the highest percentage of students who took the SHSAT test. I am making the assumption that if a student enrolled in a PASSNYC program or registered for the SHSAT test but never actually took the SHSAT test, the student found the PASSNYC program unhelpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this approach, I will have to first calculate the \"completion rate\" for each school for each year, add a column with these values and reshape the dataframe so it only contains an averaged completion rate for the years 2013-2016. In doing so, I am making the assumption that factors pertaining to the schools' demographics or ratings on factors like effectiveness, trust, and rigorous instruction are less likely to change from year to year (in short: that a school's percentage of hispanic students or rating on trust in 2013 will not look much different than in 2016). By averaging the completion rates, I am also ignoring any potential outlier years - a school which might have had a completion rate of 20% in 2013, 2014, and 2016, but a rate of only 8% in 2015. "

If I select a small k value, noise will have a higher influence on my result, but a larger k will be computationally expensive. My goal is to select a value that will produce the simplest model, without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, it is a best practice to always select an odd k value. I have decided to select 9, as it is an odd number with a relatively high accuracy. \n",
