# pass-nyc-kaggle
This project was my first attempt at machine learning. It was based on the PASSNYC Kaggle competition that ran in late 2018. After assessing the quality several different machine learning regression models, I designed a simple random forest regression model to help the non-profit PASSNYC identify the schools where minority and underserved students would be helped the most.

# Motivation 
I designed this project based on the PASSNYC Kaggle competition from late 2018, which you can read more about here: https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good. As a former elementary school teacher with a passion for both coding and social justice, this competition fit nicely into my wheelhouse. 

# Data Sources
Both datasets were taken from the Kaggle "Data Science for Social Good: PASSNYC" competition (https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good).
